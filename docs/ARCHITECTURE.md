# Atlas Engine — Architecture

This document defines the **baseline architecture** for the Atlas Engine, establishing the
structural contracts and module boundaries that all development must follow.

## Overview

Atlas is a **deterministic, tool-first game engine** extracted from the EVEOFFLINE game project.
It separates reusable engine systems from game-specific content, enabling multiple projects to
share the same core technology.

- Cache key = hash(graphID, seed, lod) for deterministic lookup
- EvictBefore(tick) removes stale entries
- Prevents redundant graph re-evaluation

- No external JSON library dependency — pure C++ standard library

### Camera / World Modes (`engine/camera/`)
- **WorldMode**: SideScroller2D, TopDown2D, TopDownOrbit2_5D, Isometric2_5D
- **CameraProjectionPolicy**: Mode-specific projection parameters
- Gameplay logic must never depend on projection
- Camera defines perception, not simulation

## Runtime Modes

| Mode   | Rendering | Networking | Asset Write | Graph Edit |
|--------|-----------|------------|-------------|------------|
| Editor | ✅         | Optional   | ✅           | ✅          |
| Client | ✅         | ✅          | ❌           | ❌          |
| Server | ❌         | ✅          | ❌           | ❌          |

## Determinism Contract

All simulation systems must satisfy:

> **Same project + same seed + same inputs = same outputs (always)**

Rules:
- No system clock access in simulation
- No global RNG — use injected `DeterministicRNG` only
- No threading outside the tick scheduler
- Fixed-point or deterministic floating-point only

## Project Schema

Projects are defined by a single `project.atlas` JSON file conforming to
`schemas/atlas.project.v1.json`. See the schema file for the full specification.

### Graph Schemas

- **WorldGraph** files (`.worldgraph`) conform to `schemas/atlas.worldgraph.v1.json`
- **StrategyGraph** files (`.strategygraph`) conform to `schemas/atlas.strategygraph.v1.json`
- **ConversationGraph** files (`.conversation`) conform to `schemas/atlas.conversation.v1.json`
- **TileGraph** files (`.tilegraph`) for 2D procedural generation
- **BehaviorGraph** files (`.behaviorgraph`) for AI behavior authoring

### Project Directory

Sample game projects live under `projects/` and are loaded via `.atlas` manifest files:

```
projects/
├── eveoffline/           # Space strategy reference project
│   └── eveoffline.atlas  # Project manifest with world graphs, strategy, AI config
├── arena2d/              # 2D arena reference project
│   └── arena2d.atlas     # Project manifest with AI, asset configuration
└── atlas-sample/         # Minimal sample project
    └── sample.atlas      # Minimal project manifest
```

## Editor Flow

1. Atlas Editor launches
2. **Project Picker** modal appears — user selects a `.atlas` file
3. Project is mounted and validated
4. Declared modules are initialized (WorldGraphs, StrategyGraphs, AI)
5. Editor enters Project Context — tools unlock
6. User can press ▶ Play to launch runtime for live testing

### Editor Panels

| Panel | Status | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Console | ✅ | Command execution and logging |
| World Graph Editor | ✅ | Visual WorldGraph authoring and preview |
| Project Picker | ✅ | Project selection and recent projects |
| Voice Commands | ✅ | Voice command testing and monitoring |
| Interaction Debugger | ✅ | AI interaction logging and analysis |
| Network Inspector | ✅ | Network state debugging |
| Game Packager | 🔧 | Build configuration UI (scaffolded) |
| ECS Inspector | ⬜ | Entity and component exploration (stub) |
| Graph Editor | ⬜ | Visual graph editing (not implemented) |
| Asset Browser | ⬜ | Asset browsing (not implemented) |

## Build System

The root `CMakeLists.txt` controls all build targets. **All targets are ON by default**
so a single build produces every executable, making everything debuggable at the same time.

| Option              | Default | Description                     |
|---------------------|---------|---------------------------------|
| BUILD_ATLAS_ENGINE  | ON      | Atlas Engine static library     |
| BUILD_ATLAS_TESTS   | ON      | Engine unit tests               |
| BUILD_ATLAS_EDITOR  | ON      | Atlas Editor application        |
| BUILD_ATLAS_RUNTIME | ON      | Atlas Runtime application       |
| BUILD_CLIENT        | ON      | Player runtime client           |
| BUILD_SERVER        | ON      | Headless dedicated server       |

Individual targets can be disabled when only a subset is needed (e.g. CI engine-only builds).

## Testing

All engine modules have corresponding test files in `tests/`.
Tests use `assert()` with `[PASS]` output and are registered in `main.cpp`.
Run with: `cd build && ctest` or `./tests/AtlasTests`
