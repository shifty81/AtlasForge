- `editor/panels/StateHashDiffPanel.cpp` - Add component breakdown
- `editor/panels/ReplayTimelinePanel.cpp` - Add input frame viewer

#### 3. CI Enhancement
**Status**: Basic determinism gate exists, needs tooling

**Remaining work**:
- [x] Implement replay minimizer
  - Automatically reduce failing replays to minimal reproduction
  - Binary search through replay frames
  - Output minimal .atlasreplay file

  - Visual diff of platform results
  - Automated bisection hints

**Files created**:
- `tools/replay_minimizer.py`
- `tools/crash_reporter.py`
- `.github/workflows/atlas_crash_reporter.yml`

### 📋 Planned (Lower Priority)

#### 4. CORE/ Namespace Enforcement
**Status**: Directory structure exists, CMake enforcement implemented

**Remaining work**:
- [x] Add CMake target dependency validation
  - Enforce that `core/` never depends on other modules
  - Enforce that `simulation/` only depends on `core/`
  - Enforce that `editor/` never links `simulation` directly
- [x] Add compile-time include guards
  - Prevent `simulation` from including `presentation` headers
  - Prevent `editor` from including `sim` internals
- [x] Document dependency graph in ARCHITECTURE.md

**Files created/modified**:
- `engine/core/contract/IncludeFirewall.h` - Compile-time include guards
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Added layer enforcement documentation

#### 5. Advanced Debugging Tools
**Status**: Not started

**Remaining work**:
- [ ] State hash diff visualizer (interactive tool)
  - Component-by-component comparison
  - Visual highlighting of changes
  - Time-travel debugging interface
- [ ] Job execution tracer
  - Per-frame job execution order
  - Timing analysis
  - Determinism verification
- [ ] Replay divergence inspector
  - Automatic divergence point detection
  - Component diff at divergence
  - Input replay from divergence

**Files to create**:
- `tools/state_diff_viewer/` - New standalone tool
- `engine/sim/JobTracer.cpp` - Enhanced implementation
- `tools/replay_inspector/` - New standalone tool

#### 6. Asset Pipeline Enhancements
**Status**: Basic pipeline exists, needs polish

**Remaining work**:
- [ ] Hot-reload for marketplace assets
  - Detect asset updates from marketplace
  - Automatic re-import
  - Version conflict resolution
- [ ] Asset validation dashboard
  - Integrity check results
  - Dependency graph visualization
  - Hash verification status
- [ ] Mod asset sandboxing
  - Deterministic hash verification
  - Permission model enforcement
  - CPU/memory budget tracking

**Files to modify**:
- `engine/assets/MarketplaceImporter.cpp` - Add hot-reload
- `editor/panels/AssetBrowserPanel.cpp` - Add validation UI
- `engine/mod/ModLoader.cpp` - Add sandboxing

## Implementation Priority Order

1. **Marketplace Integration Completion** (Highest business value)
   - Enables asset ecosystem integration
   - Differentiates Atlas from other engines
   
2. **Editor Truth UI Enhancements** (Highest developer value)
   - Critical for debugging determinism issues
   - Improves developer experience significantly

3. **CI Enhancement** (Highest quality value)
   - Reduces debugging time
   - Catches issues earlier

4. **CORE/ Namespace Enforcement** (Architectural integrity)
   - Prevents technical debt
   - Enforces clean architecture

5. **Advanced Debugging Tools** (Long-term value)
   - Nice-to-have features
   - Can be added incrementally

6. **Asset Pipeline Enhancements** (Polish)
   - Quality-of-life improvements
   - Can be deferred

## Next Steps

1. Complete marketplace importers (itch.io, Unreal, Unity)
2. Add comprehensive tests for asset importing
3. Enhance Editor Truth UI with live inspection
4. Implement replay minimizer tool
5. Add CMake dependency enforcement
